## Guidelines for Populations Structure Analyses using ddRadSeq data
The data used in these analyses correspond to 112 individuals of Campylorhynchus zonatus and Campylorhynchus fasciatus. 
The samples were collected along a precipitation gradient in the Pacific region of Ecuador, South America.
We performed several Populations Analysis to determine the population structures of these hybridazing species.
